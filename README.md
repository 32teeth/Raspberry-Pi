# Raspberry Pi

*Setup your Raspberry Pi as an Access Point and Captive Portal*

---

## Objective

You've experienced the Captive Portal process before. You walk into Starbucks, join the WiFi, get a popup asking you to join, accept, get some home page with information.

Ever wanted to **roll your own**, today, you'll learn how.

Follow along with the additional readme files in the following order:

[Access Point](Raspberry Pi - Access Point.md)
* [Server Stack](Raspberry Pi - Apache MySQL PHP Wordpress.md)
* [Virtual Servers](Raspberry Pi - Virtual Hosts.md)

Additionally, you'll need to create some additional configurations for activating the Captive Portal portion of this experience. For now, you'll have enough to go on.
